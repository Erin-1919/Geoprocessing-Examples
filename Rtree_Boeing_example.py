### First example
## Create a polygon for the boundary of a city, and points representing street intersections around it

# get the boundary of some city
gdf = ox.gdf_from_place('Walnut Creek, California, USA')

# get the street network within this bounding box
west, south, east, north = gdf.unary_union.buffer(0.1).bounds
G = ox.graph_from_bbox(north, south, east, west, network_type='drive', retain_all=True)

# get lat-long points for each intersection
xy = [(data['x'], data['y']) for node, data in G.nodes(data=True)]
x, y = list(zip(*xy))

# turn the lat-long points into a geodataframe
gdf_nodes = gpd.GeoDataFrame(data={'x':x, 'y':y})
gdf_nodes.crs = gdf.crs
gdf_nodes.name = 'nodes'
gdf_nodes['geometry'] = gdf_nodes.apply(lambda row: Point((row['x'], row['y'])), axis=1)

# make the geometry a multipolygon if it's not already
geometry = gdf['geometry'].iloc[0]
if isinstance(geometry, Polygon):
    geometry = MultiPolygon([geometry])
    
## Got the data, now visualize the points and the polygon
# plot the city
west, south, east, north = gdf.unary_union.bounds
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,6))
for polygon in geometry:
    patch = PolygonPatch(polygon, fc='#cccccc', ec='k', alpha=0.5, zorder=2)
    ax.add_patch(patch)
    
ax.set_xlim(west, east)
ax.set_ylim(south, north)
ax.axis('off')
plt.show()

# plot the intersections and the city

for polygon in geometry:
    patch = PolygonPatch(polygon, fc='#cccccc', ec='k', alpha=0.5, zorder=2)
    ax.add_patch(patch)

## Create a spatial index and find the points within the polygon
# First we have our GeoDataFrame (called gdf) create an R-tree spatial index for its geometry. 
# Then we intersect this index with the bounding box of our polygon. 
# This returns a set of possible matches. 
# That is, there are no false negatives but there may be some false positives 
# if an R-tree rectangle within the city borderâ€™s bounding box contains some points outside the city border. 
# Finally, to identify the precise matches (those points exactly within our polygon),
# we intersect the possible matches with the polygon itself
sindex = gdf_nodes.sindex
possible_matches_index = list(sindex.intersection(geometry.bounds))
possible_matches = gdf_nodes.iloc[possible_matches_index]
precise_matches = possible_matches[possible_matches.intersects(geometry)]

points_within_geometry = precise_matches
points_outside_geometry = gdf_nodes[~gdf_nodes.isin(points_within_geometry)]

# plot the cut-up city
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,6))
for polygon in geometry:
    patch = PolygonPatch(polygon, fc='#cccccc', ec='k', alpha=0.5, zorder=3)
    ax.add_patch(patch)

ax.scatter(x=points_outside_geometry['x'], y=points_outside_geometry['y'], s=1, c='r', linewidth=0, zorder=1)
ax.scatter(x=points_within_geometry['x'], y=points_within_geometry['y'], s=1, c='b', linewidth=0, zorder=2)
    
ax.set_xlim(west, east)
ax.set_ylim(south, north)
ax.axis('off')
plt.show()

### Another Example
### Problem: when the polygon's bounding box is the same as the set of points', 
### r-tree identifies every point as a possible match, thus offering no speed up. 
### When coupled with lots of points and a polygon with lots of vertices, the intersection process is very slow. 
### Example: the City of Los Angeles might take 20+ minutes.

### Solution: wrote a quadrat routine to divide the polygon into sub-polygons. 
### Then, for each sub-polygon, intersect it first with the points' r-tree index to get a small set of 
### possible matches, then intersect those possible matches with the sub-polygon to get the set of precise matches. 
### This brings computation time from 20+ minutes to a few seconds.
